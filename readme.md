# Description of project pipeline

1. Data Cleaning : 
* Process of identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in data to improve its quality and reliability.

2. Data EDA :
* Analyzing and visualizing data to understand its characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify relationships between variables.

3. Data Preprocessing : 
* Preparing and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

4. Model Building :
* Creating and training a machine learning model using the preprocessed data to make predictions or classifications based on input features.

5. Model Evaluation
* Model evaluation is the process of using different evaluation metrics to understand a machine learning modelâ€™s performance, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.
* Model evaluation is important to assess the efficacy of a model during initial research phases, and it also plays a role in model monitoring.

6. Model Deployment
* Deployment is the method by which we integrate a machine-learning model into the production environment to make practical business decisions based on data.
